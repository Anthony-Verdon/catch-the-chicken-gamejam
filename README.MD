## catch the chicken

This game has been made during IcoJam 2023 (https://itch.io/jam/icojam-2023). The theme was "3 ... 2 .. 1. ". I decided to do a game "race against time" where you must save a maximum of chicken and reunite them, and avoid the fox to eat them. The idea of "race against time" came from the count, and the idea of "reunite" came from the point which reduces over time, and "reunite". I hope you will enjoy my game ! If you find any bug, tell me.
